        Little Puppy Mazzy!

    <div class="blurb">
      <p> This is our newest pet, Mazzy! She's been here a week and is settling into a routine. The cat, Elliott, is still trying to get used to her. <br />
        She has a lot of energy and he's a little nervous. She's been fitting in really well and is very well behaved. </p>

        She napped in my cousin's car seat for the entire 2 hour drive home

    <div class="blurb">
      <p> We went and picked her up a week ago and she's been a super cute addition to our family since! <br />
        She's very friendly and gets along with everyone she's met so far. She does great in the car, on walks, and in PetSmart. </p>

    <div class="blurb">
      <p> She has one eye that's half blue and half brown and one brown eye with a blue spot. <br />
        We're not sure what kind of dog she is, but she's definitiely a mix of some kind of cattle dog and some short dog. <br />
        They think she's 6-8 months old and probably full grown. </p>

      <p> Mazzy is already potty trained and is a very fast learner. We've been teaching commands like sit, stay, drop it, and come. <br />
        She's been practicing targetting (booping her nose on a hand) and walking on a leash on the right side of you. </p>

      <p> The shelter we got her from had a ton of puppies/dogs up for adoption. You can check out listings of cute pets <a href="http://www.pet-tracs.com/index.php/adoptable-pets/adoptable-dogs.html">here</a>
