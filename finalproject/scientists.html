      <h2>
        Bill Nye the Science Guy
      </h2>
      <p> Bill Nye is someone I think most people are familiar with. He was the host of the show <i>Bill Nye the Science Guy<i> and </i> Bill Nye Saves the World </i>. A new show has also been announced called <i>The End is Nye</i>. I remember Bill Nye mostly from school. He taught young people about how science can be applied to their everyday lives and encouraged people to be curious about the world around him. His shows have always been entertaining and educational. He helped to introduce many school children to the concept of science as a whole. <br />

He was a proponent of skepital scientific thinking, curiosity, and using the scientific method. His TV show was not only visually beautiful, but was also deeply profound. It became one of the most watched shows U.S. public TV. Carl Sagan was very smart, well spoken, and had an almost hypnotic quality about him. He appeals to intellectuals everywhere in the comfort of their own homes. <br />
