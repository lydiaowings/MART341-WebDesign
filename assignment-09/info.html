      Best Star Trek Movies and TV Shows
    </h1>
    <h4>
      Ranked by Lydia, who is not objective
    </h4>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>
      The Wrath of Khan
    </h2>
    <p> The second Star Trek movie. Reintroducing Khan (seen first in TV series) as the villain of this film intent on revenge. <br />
      The Federation is attempting to perfect a tool that would inhabit other planets, but with massive genetic warfare implications. <br />
      Storyline is ok, and the film itself is very cheesy. Spock's death scene honestly changed my life and made me embrace Utilitarian values. </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>
      Deep Space Nine
    </h2>
    <p> This series takes place on a space station on the outskirts of Federation space. <br />
      Immediately following the freedom of the Bajorans from the Nazi-esque Cardassian Regime, this series explores the darker side of humanity. <br />
      This was the first and only TV show I've seen to casually mention worker's unions, Communism, and anti-Fascism in a way that promotes unity and perserverence. <br />
      This show didn't fill me with the same kind of warm and fuzzy feeling that most of Star Trek does, but it helped shape my politics. <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>
      Star Trek Into Darkness
    </h2>
    <p> The second of the J.J Abrans films, released in 2013. These films all take place in the Kelvin Timeline rather than the Prime Timeline. <br />
      Reintroducing Khan as the villain, now played by Benedict Cumberbatch, we watch familiar characters become reaquainted for the first time. <br />
      Full of action, great CGI, and a fun cast, this movie helped breathe new life and interest into Star Trek as a whole. <br />
      Reference to the original death scene mentioned above in The Wrath of Khan made me cry again. <br />
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>
      Discovery
    </h2>
    <p> The first of the modern Star Trek series still being aired. POC, LGBTQIA+, and powerful female leads litter this cast and crew. <br />
      Discovery is the first TV show in which I've seen openly queer characters, femme people, and various races/ethnicities being represented without these characteristics being defining character features. <br />
      Taking diversity and validation beyond simple existence and toward normalization, this series is furthering a cause Star Trek started 80 years ago. <br />
      The visual effects are better than ever before, and storylines are more complex- spanning a full season. <br />
