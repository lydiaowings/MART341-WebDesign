    <h1>
      Best Star Trek Characters
    </h1>
    <h4>
      As ranked by Lydia, one from each series I've seen
    </h4>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>
      Spock
    </h2>
    <p> <b>Series:</b> TOS (The Original Series) <br />
      <b>Species:</b> Half Vulcan, Half Human <br />
      <b>Role:</b> Science Officer and First Officer <br />
      <b>Why I Love:</b> A mix of logic and emotion, Spock shows us as well as his fellow characters what it means to be human while also valuing science and rational thought. <br />
      Spock is the reason I minored in Ethics. His friendships make me happy cry. </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>
      Geordi LaForge
    </h2>
    <p> <b>Series:</b> TNG (The Next Generation) <br />
      <b>Species:</b> Human <br />
      <b>Role:</b> Chief Engineer <br />
      <b>Why I Love:</b> LeVar Burton (actor) brings a dash of Reading Rainbow to this character. <br />
      Geordi spends his time saving the Enterprise, befriending the android he works alongside, and mentoring the child prodigy onboard. </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>
      Julian Bashir
    </h2>
    <p> <b>Series:</b> DS9 (Deep Space Nine) <br />
      <b>Species:</b> Genetically Enhanced Human <br />
      <b>Role:</b> Chief Medical Officer (doctor) <br />
      <b>Why I Love:</b> Introduced as a young doctor who excelled in everything he tries, Bashir was orginally painted as annoying and admittedly creepy. <br />
      As we saw the character grow and learn, his history of illegal genetic enhancement throws a wrench in his self image. <br />
      Grappling to accept himself and to be seen as legitimate, he shows strength and humility can combine without shame.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>
      B'Elanna Torres
    </h2>
    <p> <b>Series:</b> VOY (Voyager) <br />
      <b> Species:</b> Half human, Half Klingon <br />
      <b>Role:</b> Chief Engineer <br />
      <b>Why I Love:</b> Originally a hot-headed member of a terrorist organization, B'Elanna learns to accept Starfleet guidelines and finds her sensitive side along the way. <br />
      One of the first women I saw on TV in a powerful and important STEM role, B'Elanna taught young girls that being smart and interested in male-dominated fields was okay. </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>
      Hoshi Sato
    </h2>
    <p> <b>Series:</b> ENT (Enterprise) <br />
      <b> Species:</b> Human <br />
      <b>Role:</b> Communications Officer <br />
      <b>Why I Love:</b> An exo-linguist, Hoshi is responsible for communicating with completely new species in their native language. <br />
      She is responsible for programming the universal translator and ensuring diplomatic communications take place. <br />
      Stepping outside of her comfort zone, she takes on the responsiblity of representing the entire crew and quickly learning new syntax and grammar that ultimately saves lives.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>
      Saru
    </h2>
    <b>Series:</b> DISCO (Discovery) <br />
      <b> Species:</b> Kelpien <br />
      <b>Role:</b> First Officer <br />
      <b>Why I Love:</b> Born on a pre-warp planet, Saru fought his anxious instincts to communicate with and join an interstellar organization nobody on his planet knew existed. <br />
      Being thrust into the role of captain in alternate universes and timelines, Saru commands his crew with level-headed diligence after overcoming his extreme anxiety. <br />
      He also walks on hooved tip-toes, which I just think is fun. </p>
