1. The user testing session started a little rough. I wasn't sure how to get a live version of my site up, and I waited until the last day of the week to do this assignment which was silly of me. I ended up just having them use the local files I view in a browser. My dad tried to find a good/easy way for my github files to be rendered, but when that happened my fonts didn't show correctly. I'm not sure if that was a symptom of my fonts being awful, but I want to dive into that.
2. I haven't made changes yet but I plan to attempt a transparent png background pattern in the body of the pages as well as add links to relevant outside resources within their own divs at the bottom of each page.
3. I didn't know how to create a live version of my website, so instead I had them view my local files in a browser and interact with the site that way. I'm also having issues with my fonts in general. For both of these things I'm going to email my instructor and probably set up a time to meet.
