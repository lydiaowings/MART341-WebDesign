      <h2>
        They're cute!
      </h2>
      <p> They usually have stubby little legs and soft fur. <br />
        Sometimes they smile and you can see their tongues.

      <h2>
        I'm going to visit some puppies today!
      </h2>
      <p> We're driving four hours to go meet a puppy in a shelter we found online. <br />
        We might bring her home with us, but we have to make sure we click. <br />
        There are like 20 other puppies there too, so we might meet a bunch of them.

    <div>
      <h2>
        We're looking for a new bestie
      </h2>
      <p> The puppy has to be good with cats and toddlers. <br />
        My dad wanted a Corgi/Aussi mix, which is what we found. <br />
        I wonder if she'll be able to swim with her tiny legs!
