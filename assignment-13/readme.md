The goal of my website is to be a visually appealing (primarily though images) description about why I love space. I want to have a page for each of the things that makes space beautiful to me. A user might visit my site because they think space is pretty, because they really enjoy science, or because they want to learn about space for the first time in an approachable way.

Responsive web design is important because it allows for a site to automatically work on all devices. If your site only works on a desktop, it's going to be alienating to people on mobile devices. Responsive web design allows a creator to be certain that their content is going to be perceived the way they mean it to be. It also ensures that thinks like links are clickable for everyone and that images/text are appearing as they should.
