  <h2>
    Who Is This Cat?
  </h2>
    <p> This is Elliot, he is my 15 year old orange tabby. He spends the majority of his days napping on my bed while I do school work. <br>
      He likes to play with feathers, lasers, beams of light, and toy fishes. He's an avid enjoyer of sitting in laps and of watching videos of birds. <br>
      Elliot is very shy at first, but is a people person. He's never met someone he can't get along with. <br>
      He is the <em><strong>best</strong></em> cat.
